1. Class and Object 
2. Class has data/attributes and func/methods
   
   Attributes are called themselves.
   We call methods manually.

3. Why python is OOP? - Because everything is an object made in a class.

# Now i can do this :

from project import chohanbook

user1 = chohanbook()


4. End - End chohanbook made
